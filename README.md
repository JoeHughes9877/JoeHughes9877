## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Joe, a student at Aston University. I'm passionate about back-end development and enjoy programming in C. I'm particularly interested in building real-world applications that involve data processing and logic-heavy functionality.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on small projects using C and Python, with a focus on problem-solving and foundational computer science concepts.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about systems programming and strengthening my understanding of data structures and algorithms by implementing them from scratch in C.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with writing better C code and deepening my knowledge of low-level programming concepts.
